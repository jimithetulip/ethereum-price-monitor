# ethereum-price-monitor

## What does it do ?

All it does is monitor the price of Ethereum on GDAX. It updates every 10 seconds. Handy for those of you that want to keep and inconspicuous eye
on the price of Ether.

## How do I install it ?

It's not available in the chrome app store yet as I need to muster up $5.

You can just install it manually tho. 

1. Download the git repository.
2. Browse to <a href="chrome://extensions">chrome://extensions<a>.
3. Turn on developer mode in the top right.
4. Click the load unpacked button link.
5. Browse to the github folder and hit open.


That's It! You should now have a little extension in your chrome toolbar that shows the price of Ether. Yay.

It will be available on the app store once I get $5 :)

Thanks :)
